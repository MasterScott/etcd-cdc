# etcd-cdc
Decentralised NVMe discovery using the etcd key-value store

## Overview
etcd-cdc implements a distributed NVMe discovery system, where each storage
node is part of an etcd cluster. It consists of two parts:

1) etcd-cdc
Monitors the nvmet configfs via inotify(3) and generates discovery information
which is stored as keys in etcd.

2) etcd-discovery
Watches for key changes in etcd and generates discovery information usable for
nvme-cli to connect to the remote systems (TBD).

## Discovery keys
The keys have this format:

~~~
nvmet/<hostnqn>/<subsysnqn>/<portid>/{traddr,trtype,trsvcid}
~~~

This makes is particularly easy to generate discovery information, as each
host just has to fetch all keys with the prefix

~~~
nvmet/<hostnqn>
~~~

## Lifetime of generated keys
etcd-cdc will request a lease on startup, and all keys are stored in etcd
with this lease attached. This avoids the discovery information getting stale
as etcd will remove these keys once the lease expires.
etcd-cdc will refresh the lease in regular intervals during runtime.
On shutdown etcd-cdc will issue a 'revoke' request on that lease, which will
remove all keys generated by this particular instance.
